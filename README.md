# Nyo Crypto Wallet
### It's a simple testnet/mainnet bitcoin wallet generator.

As an example, you could see a nyo-crypto-wallet created at [BlockCypher explorer](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc-testnet/address/mzNJTsGJMh9XPqyB6s3R6sMKpYtAZE11nm/).<br/>
The wallet address is: `mzNJTsGJMh9XPqyB6s3R6sMKpYtAZE11nm`
<p>
To create a new one, just init a node project (`npm init`), and then type `node src/createWallet.js`.
